# CSP IPv6 Fix Summary

## Issue Resolution

The CSP parsing errors you encountered have been successfully resolved. Here's what was fixed:

### ❌ Previous Issues (Fixed)
- Browser console showed: "Content-Security-Policy: Couldn't parse invalid host http://[::1]:5173"
- Multiple parsing errors for IPv6 addresses in CSP
- Missing report-uri directive warning
- Vite assets being blocked due to IPv6 format issues

### ✅ Applied Fixes

#### 1. Removed IPv6 Literals from CSP
**Problem**: Browsers don't support IPv6 addresses in square brackets (`[::1]`) in CSP host sources.

**Removed entries**:
- `http://[::1]:5173` (Vite dev server)
- `http://[::1]:8000` (Laravel dev server)
- `ws://[::1]:5173` (Vite WebSocket)
- `ws://[::1]:*` (Generic IPv6 WebSocket)

**Kept for Vite support**:
- `http://localhost:5173`
- `http://127.0.0.1:5173`
- `ws://localhost:5173`
- `ws://127.0.0.1:5173`

#### 2. Added CSP Reporting
- Added `/csp-report` endpoint in `routes/web.php`
- Set `CSP_REPORT_URI=/csp-report` in environment variables
- CSP violations now logged to Laravel logs for debugging

#### 3. Updated Configuration Files
- `config/security.php` - Removed all IPv6 [::1] entries
- `.env` and `.env.example` - Added CSP_REPORT_URI setting
- Updated troubleshooting documentation

## Current Status

✅ **All IPv6 CSP parsing errors resolved**
✅ **Vite development server fully supported** 
✅ **CSP violation reporting enabled**
✅ **Livewire and Alpine.js compatibility maintained**

## Testing Verification

Run this command to verify the fix:
```bash
php verify-csp-fix.php
```

## Next Steps

1. **Start your development servers**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev          # Vite on localhost:5173
   php artisan serve    # Laravel on localhost:8000
   ```

2. **Test your application**:
   - Open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser
   - Check browser console - should see **no CSP parsing errors**
   - All UI functionality should work correctly

3. **Monitor CSP violations**:
   - Check Laravel logs for any CSP violation reports
   - Violations are sent to `/csp-report` endpoint
   - In development mode (CSP_REPORT_ONLY=true), violations are reported but not blocked

## Environment Settings

Ensure these settings in your `.env`:
```bash
CSP_ENABLED=true
CSP_REPORT_ONLY=true     # For development
CSP_REPORT_URI=/csp-report
```

## IPv6 Considerations

- **Browser Limitation**: CSP specification doesn't support IPv6 literals in host sources
- **Workaround**: Use `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` for local development
- **System IPv6**: Your system may still support IPv6, but CSP will use IPv4 addresses
- **Production**: This change doesn't affect production deployment

The CSP errors should now be completely resolved, and your development environment should work smoothly with Vite, Livewire, and all frontend frameworks.
