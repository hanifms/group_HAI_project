# Web Application Security: Task Distribution & Remediation

This document outlines the tasks for our web application security assignment, focusing on fixing vulnerabilities identified by the latest ZAP scan report. The full ZAP report (`ZAP by Checkmarx Scanning Report.pdf`) has been uploaded to the repository for your reference.

**Important:** Please work on your assigned branch (`Hanif`, `Arman`, `Iz'aan`) and do NOT push directly to `main`. Once your tasks are completed, create a Pull Request (PR) to `main`.

## ðŸŽ¯ Task Assignments

Each of us has a set of vulnerabilities to investigate, understand, and fix.

### **Hanif (Leader)**

**Focus Area:** Critical security configurations and overall project management.

**My Tasks:**

1.  **Content Security Policy (CSP) Header Not Set (Medium Risk):**
    * **Action:** This is a high-impact fix. Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) header. This is a powerful defense against XSS and data injection. Start with a strict policy and gradually relax it as needed for your application. Laravel allows setting this via middleware. The report highlights `http://127.0.0.1:8000/sitemap.xml` as an example affected URL.
2.  **Overall PR Merging & Final Report Compilation:**
    * **Action:** I will be responsible for reviewing and merging Pull Requests from Arman and Iz'aan into the `main` branch. Also, I will compile the final report document, integrating everyone's findings and fixes.
3.  **Create Tests**
    * **Action** I will be creating tests to ease workflow and to make sure the website does not break

### **Arman**

**Focus Area:** HTTP Security Headers & Server Information Disclosure.

**Your Tasks:**

1.  **Missing Anti-clickjacking Header (Medium Risk):**
    * **Action:** Implement `X-Frame-Options` or a Content Security Policy (CSP) `frame-ancestors` directive to prevent clickjacking. Laravel middleware can be used for this. The report shows `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` as an example affected URL.
2.  **X-Content-Type-Options Header Missing (Low Risk):**
    * **Action:** Implement the `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` header to prevent browsers from MIME-sniffing responses away from the declared content-type. The report shows `http://127.0.0.1:8000/robots.txt` as an example.
3.  **Server Leaks Information via "X-Powered-By" HTTP Response Header Field(s) (Low Risk):**
    * **Action:** Research how to suppress or remove the `X-Powered-By` header in your web server configuration (Nginx/Apache) or Laravel. This reduces information leakage. The report shows `http://127.0.0.1:8000/sitemap.xml` as an example.

### **Iz'aan**

**Focus Area:** Redirects, Cookie Security, and Informational Findings.

**Your Tasks:**

1.  **Big Redirect Detected (Potential Sensitive Information Leak) (Low Risk):**
    * **Action:** Investigate the `POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/Login` redirect. Ensure redirects, especially after authentication, do not leak sensitive information in the URL or via referers. Implement safe redirect practices (e.g., only redirecting to internal, whitelisted URLs, using `intended()` in Laravel).
2.  **Cookie No HttpOnly Flag (Low Risk):**
    * **Action:** Ensure all cookies (especially session cookies and remember-me tokens) have the `HttpOnly` flag set. This prevents client-side scripts from accessing the cookie, mitigating certain XSS attack vectors. Laravel's session configuration handles this, but review `config/session.php`. The report shows `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` as an example.
3.  **Cross-Domain JavaScript Source File Inclusion (Low Risk):**
    * **Action:** Review `http://127.0.0.1:8000/sitemap.xml` (as per report) and any other scripts. Ensure that all JavaScript source files are loaded securely and are not susceptible to cross-domain inclusion issues. This might relate to your CSP, or ensuring external scripts are from trusted CDNs/sources and properly hashed if using CSP.
4.  **Informational Findings Review:**
    * **Action:** Review `Authentication Request Identified` (`POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/login`), `Modern Web Application` (`http://127.0.0.1:5000/`), and `Session Management Response Identified` (`http://127.0.0.1:8000/`). While informational, understand why ZAP flags these. For example, ensure Laravel's authentication and session management are robust (e.g., regenerate session ID on login, appropriate session lifetimes). You don't necessarily need to "fix" these if they are secure by design, but document your understanding.

## âœ… Workflow & Next Steps

1.  **Fetch & Switch:** Everyone, please `git fetch` and then `git checkout your-branch-name` (or `git checkout -b your-branch-name origin/your-branch-name` if it's your first time).
2.  **Implement Fixes:** Work on your assigned tasks within your branch.
3.  **Commit Regularly:** Use clear commit messages.
4.  **Push to Your Branch:** `git push origin your-branch-name` when you have meaningful progress.
5.  **Create Pull Request (PR):** Once you believe your assigned vulnerabilities are fixed, create a PR from your branch to `main` on GitHub. Describe what you fixed.
6.  **Review:** Hanif will review your PRs. Please also review each other's PRs to learn and provide feedback.
7.  **Merge:** Once approved, Hanif will merge the PR.
8.  **Re-scan & Verify:** After each merge to `main`, Hanif will run a new ZAP scan to confirm fixes and ensure no new issues arose.
9.  **Report Contribution:** Everyone will be responsible for documenting their assigned vulnerabilities, the fixes implemented, and the verification steps for the final report.

Let's get this done! If you have questions about your specific tasks, please refer to the ZAP report and conduct some online research regarding Laravel best practices for those vulnerabilities. Also feel free to chat in whastap
